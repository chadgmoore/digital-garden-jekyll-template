These are my notes about scanning film negatives with the [Lomo Digitaliza Max](https://shop.lomography.com/us/digitaliza-max) scanner and the snapseed application.

When having the film developed at the lab, ask them to not cut the negatives so that the scanning process is easier.

## Scanning

Try this at night or in the dark to avoid light spillage.

1. Put film into loader try to keep the scanner level
2. Put camera onto holder 
3. Use the cameras level app to make sure its level
4. Use the phone camera to take photos
5. Synch to look at photos on iPad for a bigger and better view of the scan 
6. Delete and repeat if there is light leakage (this makes the sprocket holes look blue on a sunny day) or focus issues, etc
7. Scan each shot on the roll

## Processing negatives to positives

This is specific to the process in the SnapSeed app, although generally this should work in any imaging app. 

Two important factors:

1. Crop the image before tinkering with the curves so that the curves aren't considering wasted color info that you'll crop out later.
2. Use the RGB curve adjustments individually

Step by Step:

1. Open the negative image
2. Rotate (auto) then 90 degrees until it's correctly laid out
3. Crop to trim pic
4. Curves
   1. Pay close attention to the histogram. 
      1. Move the curve horizontally to the edges of the color spectrum on both sides, then vertically from top to bottom, or bottom to top to "flip" it to a positive. 
      2. Repeat for each channel Adjust again for effect.
5. Add other effects/adjustment if needed
6. Export
