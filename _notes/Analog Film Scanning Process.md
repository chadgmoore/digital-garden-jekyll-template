## Scanning

Try this at night or in the dark to avoid light spillage
Put film into loader. try to keep the scanner level.
Put camera onto holder. Use the cameras level app to make sure its level. 
Use camera to take photos
Synch to look at photos on iPad for a better view of the scan. Delete and repeat if there is light leakage (this makes the sprocket holes look blue on a sunny day) or focus issues, etc.

## Processing negatives to positives

Snapseed process (this will work in any imaging app). Two important factors

1. Crop the image before tinkering with the curves so that the curves aren't considering wasted color info that you'll crop out later.
2. Use the RGB curve adjustments individually

Step by Step:

* Open image
* Rotate (auto) then 90 degrees until it's correct
* Crop to trim pic
* Curves
	* Pay attention to the histogram. Move the curve horizontally to the edges of the color spectrum on both sides, then vertically to "flip" it to a positive. Repeat for each channel. Then adjust again for effect.
* Other effects if needed
* Export
