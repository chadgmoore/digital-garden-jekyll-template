To categorize the notes, use the metaphor of an apple from seedling to fruit for the growth of items in a garden, so that I may tend to the knowledge. Categorize posts this way.

This note, as of right now is a 🌱 #seedling 
Lets see if I can link to the categories on the website...

## 🌱 seedling
Raw ideas, links I've captured, and some notes on them. 

## 🌿 growing
More fleshed out ideas than the seedling.

## 🌳 tree
These are sort of like areas from PARA. Notes that are like categories of information. 

## 🍎 fruit
Finished notes, or at least publishable.
