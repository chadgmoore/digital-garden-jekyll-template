ðŸ‘‹ hi there, I'm Chad. This is my collection of ideas. AKA a digital garden.

I'm interested in [[acting]], [[analog photography]], [[Buddhism]], [[Absurdism]] as a philosphy, [[animation]], [[sketchnotes]] and [[graphic facilitation]], [[futures thinking]], and [[sketch comedy]].

You can find my writing and other odds and ends [Where Light Gathers](https://wherelightgathers.com).

Have a great day.
