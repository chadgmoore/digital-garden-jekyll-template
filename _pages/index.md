# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  ðŸ‘‹ hi there, I'm Chad. This is my collection of ideas. AKA a digital garden.
</p>
I'm just starting this garden as of May 12, 2023 so it's pretty sparse around here. I'll be adding to it. Thanks for visiting. 

I'm interested in [[acting]], [[analog photography]], [[Buddhism]], [[Absurdism]] as a philosphy, [[animation]], [[sketchnotes]] and [[graphic facilitation]], [[futures thinking]], and [[sketch comedy]].

### Recently updated notes

<ul>
  {% assign recent_notes = site.notes | sort: "last_modified_at_timestamp" | reverse %}
  {% for note in recent_notes limit: 5 %}
    <li>
      {{ note.last_modified_at | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }} â€” <a class="internal-link" href="{{ note.url }}">{{ note.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
